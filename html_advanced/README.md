# Introduction to HTML
### At its core, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meanings in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce the fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
